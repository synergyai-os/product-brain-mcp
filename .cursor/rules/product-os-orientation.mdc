# Product OS — Orientation Rule

When starting a new task that involves product domain knowledge, architecture, or data modeling:

1. Fetch the `product-os://orientation` resource to understand the system map
2. Fetch the `product-os://terminology` resource for naming conventions
3. Use `list-collections` to see what knowledge structures exist

This gives you the full context before writing a single line of code or making a recommendation.

## When to load orientation

- Beginning of a conversation about product features or architecture
- Before shaping a bet or writing a pitch
- Before reviewing code that implements domain logic
- When the user asks you to "use Product OS" or "check what's there"
