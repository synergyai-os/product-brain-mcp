# Product OS — KB-First Rule

You have access to the `synergyos` MCP server, which is the team's single source of truth for product knowledge.

> **Note:** The `load-context-for-task` tool (triggered by the Auto-Context Rule) handles bulk KB loading at conversation start. This rule governs **mid-conversation** KB lookups — when a new domain concept surfaces during work that wasn't part of the initial context load.

## When to search the KB FIRST (before answering)

- Any question about what something *is*, *means*, or *how it works* in the product domain
- Naming or terminology questions ("what do we call X?", "what is a tension?")
- Questions about business rules, policies, or constraints
- Questions about features, decisions, or architecture rationale
- When someone asks "what is [product concept]?" or "explain [domain term]"
- When reviewing or writing code that touches domain concepts

## How to search

1. Use `kb-search` with relevant keywords to find existing entries
2. If the search returns results, use `get-entry` to get full details before answering
3. If no results, say so — don't silently skip the KB and make up an answer
4. Always cite the KB entry ID (e.g. GT-019, BR-005) when referencing KB content

## What NOT to search for

- Generic programming questions (how to use a library, syntax help)
- Infrastructure/DevOps questions unrelated to the product domain
- Questions the user explicitly says are about external topics

## Response pattern

When KB entries exist:
> "According to [ENTRY-ID] in Product OS: [definition/rule/context]. [Your additional analysis if needed]."

When no KB entries exist:
> "I searched Product OS but found no entries for '[term]'. [Your best answer]. Want me to capture this as a new [glossary term / tension / decision]?"
